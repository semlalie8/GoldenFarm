    "about_story_p1": "GoldenFarm is more than a platform — it’s a bridge between Morocco’s proud agricultural heritage and its digital future. Born from the heart of the countryside, our mission began with a simple belief: that the true wealth of Morocco lies in its farmers — the men and women who nurture life from the soil, generation after generation.",
    "about_story_p2": "In villages scattered across the plains, valleys, and mountains, we saw potential waiting to bloom. Small farmers with deep knowledge of their land, yet limited access to finance and markets. GoldenFarm emerged to change that — to give these rural heroes the tools, transparency, and visibility they deserve.",
    "about_story_p3": "We combine tradition and technology, turning the art of farming into an accessible and trackable investment opportunity. Through our platform, every project is transparent, measurable, and designed for real impact — empowering investors to see their contribution grow alongside the lives it transforms.",
    "about_story_p4": "At GoldenFarm, progress isn’t just about profit; it’s about people, the land, and a shared responsibility for the future. By connecting global investors with local farmers, we are cultivating a new model of growth — one rooted in sustainability, dignity, and trust.",
    "about_story_p5": "Together, we’re sowing the seeds of tomorrow — one animal, one crop, one family at a time. Every project we support is transparent, trackable, and built to strengthen both livelihoods and the environment.",
